# Learning Letters / Evvie's Letter Game

Thanks for checking out Evvie's letter game. Evvie is my two year old son. His name is
Evan, but we just call him Evvie. This game was designed to give him a way to practice
his uppercase letters. When I have more time, I'll add a way to toggle between uppercase
and lowercase letters. Another TODO is to write more tests for it. Currently, I have
a great many things competing for my time, but I'd love to be able to add onto the few
tests that I did have time to write.
